## Which Phineas and Ferb character are you?
### Take this quiz and find out!

There's 64 days of summer vacation <br/>
And college comes along just to end it <br/>
So the annual problem for our generation <br/>
Is finding a good way to spend it<br/>
<br/>
Like maybe... <br/>
Building [FOSS website](https://github.com/IIITKalyaniFOSC/iiitkalyanifosc.github.io) <br/>
Or [designing a logo](https://github.com/IIITKalyaniFOSC/design-jam) <br/>
Or [making a meme generator](https://github.com/IIITKalyaniFOSC/memelabs) <br/>
<br/>
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Algorithm!) <br/>
Or Raspberry Pi based automator <br/>

Watching good movies <br/>
[Writing poems](https://medium.com/@pulkitmishra) <br/>
__Or making Phineas and Ferb Quiz (It's over here!)__ <br/>
<br/>
Learning data structures <br/>
Mastering Python <br/>
Or learning the blockchain biz (Bitcoin!) <br/>
<br/>
As you can see <br/>
There's a whole lot of stuff to do <br/>
Before college starts this fall (Come on Dobby!) <br/>
<br/>
So stick with me 'cause I am <br/>
gonna do it all! <br/>
So stick with me 'cause I am <br/>
Gonna do it all! <br/>
